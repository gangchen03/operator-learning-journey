# Learn to Build Kubernetes Operators

> Collection of learning material for building Kubernetes Operators.
> As a big fan of automating everything in Kubernetes, Operator pattern got my interests quickly.
> However, it took me a while to figure out the technical know-how of building an Operator.
> I hope that this learning journey from my learning experience will help the builder get started faster.
